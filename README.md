Based on the MODIS dataset for wildfire management in Thailand, here is a summary of the hotspot data spanning from 2020 to early 2025:

Overview of Wildfire Hotspots (2020–2025)
The cumulative analysis of the MODIS dataset reveals a total of 127,165 hotspots detected across Thailand during this period. The data indicates significant annual fluctuations, reflecting varying climatic conditions and the effectiveness of seasonal fire management strategies.

Annual Hotspot Trends
The frequency of hotspots varies considerably by year, with 2020 recording the highest activity and 2022 showing a notable decline:

2020: Recorded the peak activity with 33,463 hotspots.
2021: Saw a significant reduction, dropping to 17,596 hotspots.
2022: Marked the lowest point in the recorded period with only 9,309 hotspots.
2023: Experienced a sharp resurgence in fire activity, rising to 29,237 hotspots.
2024: Continued high activity with 21,568 hotspots recorded.
2025 (Partial): As of early March 2025, 15,992 hotspots have already been detected, indicating a potentially intense fire season for the current year.
Data Characteristics
The hotspot maps provide critical spatial and temporal information for wildfire management, including:

Confidence Levels: Individual detections often show high confidence (e.g., up to 100%) in fire presence.
Fire Radiative Power (FRP): This metric measures the heat output of the fires, with recorded values ranging from moderate (e.g., 11.40 MW) to high-intensity (e.g., 112.00 MW).
Geographic Distribution: The data maps show widespread activity across Thailand, with concentrations typically appearing in agricultural zones and forest areas during the dry season.
This summary supports the "Hotspot FireWatch Thailand" initiative by providing the baseline data needed to identify high-risk zones and evaluate the impact of wildfire mitigation efforts over time.
